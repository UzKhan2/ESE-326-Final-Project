# ESE-326-Final-Project

Design, implement, and experiment a placement algorithm with the following characteristics:                                                                      

- The algorithm implements Timberwolf placement (placement using Simulated Annealing)
- The algorithm considers standard cell placement, e.g., all cells are placed in rows
- The algorithm minimizes the total IC area after placement
- The algorithm maximizes the expected routability of interconnect
- The algorithm minimizes the expected total interconnect length
 
 <br /> Program inputs:

- Circuit netlist
- Area
- Position of I/O pins on the pad frame
